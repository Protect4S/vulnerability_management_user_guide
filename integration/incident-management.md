# Incident Management

## ServiceNow - Incident Management

### Prerequisites

The technical connection to be used must be created upfront so that it can be selected later. This is done as follows:

In the Protect4S system, start transaction SM59 and create an RFC destination of type type G as in the example shown below:

* Enter the details relevant for your ServiceNow instance (hostname, port, user and password).
* Select the SSL client PSE to use HTTPS for the connection. Make sure to trust the ServiceNow HTTPS endpoint by adding the relevant certificate to the Certificate List of the selected PSE (transactions STRUST).
