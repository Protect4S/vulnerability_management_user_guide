# SAPControl security settings

In the system creation wizard, an SAPControl connection can be made using different variants for HTTP and HTTPS. These are detailed below.

## HTTP

HTTP is the default variant and requires no additional settings. To authenticate on SAPControl, an OS username and password must be specified, preferably the \<sid>adm user. For some system types, the connection can be setup without an OS username and password, using the button 'Without user'. In this case, the connection is setup without authentication. Note the following:

* The specified OS username and password is sent accross unencrypted from the Protect4S system to the satellite system. Using HTTPS is recommened.
* Without a username/password, the SAPControl connection is only used for the instance information of the system. Some checks will not be executed.

## HTTPS

It is recommended to use HTTPS for the SAPControl connection. This requires additional configuration. The following is required for each scenario:

* On the Protect4S system, the HTTPS service must be permanently activated (transaction SMICM).&#x20;
* The HTTPS port (5<##>14) is enabled on the SAP start service (sapstartsrv).&#x20;
* The 'SSL client SSL Client (Anonymous)' PSE is activated (transaction STRUST) and the certificate of the HTTPS sapstartsrv is trusted by the PSE by adding the certificate to the certificate list.

### Without user

Similar to the HTTP variant, for some system types the connection can be setup without an OS username and password. Use the button 'Without user' and leave the SSL Client PSE setting to 'DFAULT'.

### Basic authentication

It is recommended ot specify the OS username and password to include all checks. Leave the SSL Client PSE setting to 'DFAULT'.

### Certificate-based authentication

Instead of an OS username and password, it is possible to use certificate-based authentication. Keep in mind that the Protect4S system acts as a client and the sapstartsrv as a server component. The following is required:

* A separate 'SSL Client Identity' must be created and activated on the Protect4S VM system (transaction STRUST).
* The certificate of the PSE must be **trusted** by the sapstartsrv. This is done by adding the certificate to the service PSE of sapstartsrv (default: SAPSSLS.pse).
* The certificate of the PSE must be **configured** on the sapstartsrv. This is done by specifying the allowed attributes using parameter 'service/sso\_admin\_user\_xâ€™.&#x20;
* In the wizard screen, the 'OS user name' and 'password' field need to be empty, and the created SSL Client PSE must be selected.

## Retrieving the sapstartsrv certificate and import in PSE

There are several opportunies to retrieve the certificate. Using a browser is a practical option.

* From a (client) system that can connect to the satellite system, navigate to https://\<satellite hostname>:5<##>14 where ## is the instance number.
* Display the certificate from the browser and save it locally.
* Import the certifiate in the intended PSE.
