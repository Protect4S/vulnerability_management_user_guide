# Creating a BusinessObjects system

### Business Objects Setup

SAP Business Objects systems can also be configured as a source system. A prerequisite to do this is the existence of the RestFul Webervice. See t[his URL ](https://blogs.sap.com/2017/12/15/bi-platform-rest-sdk-rws-in-boe-4.2/)for more information. To connect a Business Objects system; select the System Type "BusinessObjects BI" when creating a new system.

In the next screen of the System wizard, supply the connection parameters:

The hostname and port number plus a user and password are needed here.

The created System-ID for BO systems is done based on the systems' role. The naming convention is "BO" where one letter is added. For example a "P" for production and a "D" for development.
