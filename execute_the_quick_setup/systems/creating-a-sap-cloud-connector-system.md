Additional checks can be performed via a SAPControl connection. Because the Cloud Connector does not have a sapstart service itself, this is only possible if another SAP instance is installed on the same host, that does have a sapstartsrv. To install a standalone SMD agent via SWPM see SAP Note [2253383](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2253383). Note the following:

* the \<sid>adm of the other SAP instance must be used (not another OS user).
* the \<sid>adm user of the other SAP instance must have read access to the files in the Cloud Connector path. On unix based systems, this can be done by adding the user to the sccgroup.
* this connection is optional and can be skipped.
