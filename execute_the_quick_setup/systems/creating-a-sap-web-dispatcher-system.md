# Creating a SAP Web Dispatcher system

### **SAP Web Dispatcher setup**

SAP Web Dispatchers that have been installed with SWPM (those that have a SAPControl interface), can also be scanned by Protect4S VM. To create such a system connection, select the System Type "Web dispatcher" when creating a new system.

After providing the system attributes, the wizard will start a SAP Control connection setup as described in the next section.

For so-called "flat" SAP Web Dispatchers, it is necessary to integrate it into the SAP Start Service first as described in the section labelled "SAP Start Service integration" as described in this blog: [https://blogs.sap.com/2014/08/27/how-to-create-a-flat-sap-web-dispatcher-installation-on-windows/](https://blogs.sap.com/2014/08/27/how-to-create-a-flat-sap-web-dispatcher-installation-on-windows/)

The created System-ID for WD systems is always called "WDP".
