# Creating a SAProuter system

SAProuters can also be scanned by Protect4S VM if another SAP system is installed on the same host or if a standalone SMD agent is installed on the same host and if these can be reached over the network on port 5XX13 (HTTP) or 5XX14 (HTTPS). To install a standalone SMD agent via SWPM see SAP Note [2253383](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2253383).

Next, to create such a system connection, select the System Type "SAProuter" when creating a new system and fill the needed information:

![SAProuter connection data](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png>)

In the case of a standalone SMD agent you can use the DAAADM user or you can use the \<sid>adm user of another SAP instance or a custom created OS user.

Also make sure to point the connection wizard to the Developer trace of the SAProuter as by default in /usr/sap/saprouter/dev\_rout for linux or c:\usr\sap\saprouter\dev\_rout for windows or as specified differently via the SAProuter -T flag.
