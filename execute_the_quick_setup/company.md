A company is the owner of a group of SAP systems. If the Protect4S system is used to support the systems of various companies and Protect4S VM must execute vulnerability assessments on these systems, then these companies should be added to the master data.

In the Quick Setup wizard step "Company", select the button "New Company" to add a Company to Protect4S VM:
