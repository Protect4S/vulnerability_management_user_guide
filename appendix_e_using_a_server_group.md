# Appendix E: using a server group

In order to enable parallel processing and avoid overloading the Dialog work processes of the Protect4S system, it is possible to configure a Server group using transaction RZ12.

1\. Determine how many Dialog work processes you have available using transaction SM50.

Example: you have 10 DIA work processes.

2\. Determine how many you want to use for parallel processing.

Example: you want to use up to 6 parallel processes.

3\. Transaction RZ12, press the button "Create assignment" and supply a name ("Protect4S") and assign it to an instance.

In the next popup "Apply current quotas", select Yes and set the "Minimum number of Free WPs" to 4. (The value 4 being the Amount of available work processes (1) minus the amount that should be used for parallel processing (2).
