# Appendix I HTTPURLLOC table

In case you use the HTTPURLLOC table to route specific HTTP requests to a JAVA stack and others to the ABAP stack, make sure to route the /WEBDYNPRO/ESEC/\* URL's to the ABAP stack of the SAP Solution Manager. Otherwise they may end up on the JAVA stack, which does not work.

A valid entry in the table specificly might look like this:

![Table HTTPURLLOC change](<.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

Where the PORT (443 in this case) is the ABAP port as defined in transaction SMICM --> Services and the HOST is the hostname of the Protect4S system.

**Make sure to set the SORT KEY field to a low value so this entry will have priority over other entries.**
