# Add-On Installation, import support packages and upgrade

## Add-On Installation <a href="#addon-installation" id="addon-installation"></a>

Protect4S is delivered as an SAP Add-On and must be applied through the usual Add-On installation process using transaction SAINT in client 000 of the relevant Protect4S system.

New Protect4S Installations require the Protect4S 6.0 package plus the latest Protect4S Support package. These can be installed in a single SAINT queue.

Support packages are non-incremental (**they contain all predecessors**) and can be merged into the installation queue.

New Protect4S Installations require the Protect4S 6.0 Base package **plus the latest available** Protect4S Support package. These can be installed in a single SAINT queue.

During the installation, a warning may state that the Base package or Support Package are not digitally signed, however this is normal behavior (see also OSS Note [2645739](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2645739)), and the warning can be ignored. Protect4S customers can always check the downloaded Support Packages against the SHA256 checksum on the Protect4S website:

(See SAP help : [SAP Add-On Installation Tool](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SAP\_ADD-ON\_INSTALLATION\_TOOL\_AND\_SUPPORT\_PACKAGE\_MANAGER/LATEST/en-US))

After the installation or upgrade, Post-processing must be executed _via transaction **/n/ESEC/SA\_PI**_ in the productive client you use Protect4S in.

## Importing Support packages <a href="#importing_support_packages" id="importing_support_packages"></a>

When Protect4S is already installed and you want to update to the latest Support Pack you can use the regular SAP transaction SPAM in client 000 to import the most recent Support Package.&#x20;

The latest protect4S Support Package can be obtained via [https://protect4s.com/login](https://protect4s.com/login) with your personal user-ID. If you don't have one please [contact](https://vmuserguide.protect4s.com/contact-us) our support team.

Keep in mind that the Protect4S Support Packages are non-cumulative, so **you just need the latest Support Package** as it contains all previous functionality as well. Support packages for Protect4S can only be installed after the initial Protect4S 6.0 package is installed.

_**Important**: After having imported the latest support Package make sure to run the Post-Installation wizard via transaction **/n/ESEC/SA\_PI**_ in the productive client you use Protect4S in.

## Upgrade from Protect4S 5.x to 6.0

Protect4S 6 is a new major version that can be installed newly or over the existing 5.x installation using transaction SAINT in client 000. Support packages for Protect4S 6.0 can be installed together with the initial Protect4S 6.0 base package in one run.

For the prerequisites for Protect4S 6 see the Chapter[ Software version requirements](../pre-conditions\_and\_installation/software\_version\_requirements.md).

After __ importing Protect4S 6, the installation Post-processing must be executed with transaction _ **/n/ESEC/SA\_PI**_ in the productive client. __&#x20;
