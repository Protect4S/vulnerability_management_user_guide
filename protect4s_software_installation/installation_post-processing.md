## Check that HTTP(S) service is active <a href="#check-that-http-s-service-is-active" id="check-that-http-s-service-is-active"></a>

Make sure that at least one HTTP(S) service is active using transaction SMICM before continuing with the next step.

See transaction: SMICM, Goto, Services \<Shift-F1>

## Run the post-installation wizard <a href="#run-the-post-installation-wizard" id="run-the-post-installation-wizard"></a>

Run the post-installation wizard **in every client where Protect4S VM needs to run,** but not in client 000 as it is a best practice to use a separate client for Protect4S VM. The post-installation wizard is started by executing transaction: **/n/ESEC/SA\_PI**. Do this with a user that at least has the role **/ESEC/SA\_ADMINISTRATOR**.

The wizard will activate the necessary SICF services (see [appendix D](../appendix\_d\_protect4s\_sicf\_services.md)). It will also prompt for the license installation and [Quick setup](../execute\_the\_quick\_setup/).

## License installation <a href="#license-installation" id="license-installation"></a>

Protect4S VM needs an installed and valid license in order to execute. The first time that Protect4S VM is started, this license must be installed. A valid license file will be supplied by the Protect4S support team during the purchasing process.

#### Requesting a new Protect4S VM license

Requesting a new Protect4S VM license can be done simply by selecting the option "Request license" from the menu:

![Requesting a Protect4S license](<../.gitbook/assets/image (240).png>)

This will show you the relevant information of the Protect4S system (System number and Installation number as can be found in the transaction SLICENSE of the central Protect4S system) that we need for generating the license:

![Supplying the information needed for the license](<../.gitbook/assets/image (184).png>)

When the "Open e-mail" option is chosen, a mail will be created for the Protect4S support team containing the relevant information for us to generate your license file:

![License request by mail](<../.gitbook/assets/image (234).png>)

Then, send the mail to the Protect4S support team to receive a generated license.

* âœ” Should you have lost this file or never received it, please contact the Protect4S support team.

#### Uploading the license file

![Protect4S License administration](<../.gitbook/assets/image (73).png>)

Press Close in order to inspect the Application settings.

After confirmation of this popup, you must supply data for the application settings: a background user that runs the scan jobs (This must be a user with the role **/ESEC/SA\_BACKGROUND\_EXECUTOR**), an [optional server group](../appendix\_e\_using\_a\_server\_group.md) to limit the amount of dialog work processes used for parallel scan processing and a reply-to email address for the notification mails send from Protect4S VM. Make sure to also set the Background job in the lower part of the screen to _Active_ to make sure notifications are received if desired.
