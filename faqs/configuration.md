## What connections are required for a satellite system?

Depending on the system type, connections can be required or optional. Note that skipping optional connections result in some checks not being exectuted. Below table shows which type of connection is required (R) or optional (O) per system type.

| **System type**    | **Application** | **Database** | **Operation system** |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| ABAP               | R               | O            | O                    |
| Java               | R               | R            | R                    |
| Dual stack         | R               | R            | R                    |
| Web Dispatcher     | -               | -            | R                    |
| HANA standalone    | -               | R            | R                    |
| BusinessObjects BI | R               | -            | -                    |
| SAProuter          | -               | -            | R                    |
| Cloud Connector    | R               | -            | O                    |

## Can Protect4S VM re-use existing connections to satellite systems?

Protect4S VM creates separate connections for each system that is created within the application. Existing connections (for example: RFC connections) that may exist in the system that is used for Protect4S VM, cannot be re-used. This way, functionality is separated and dedicated users are used that only have the authorisations required.&#x20;
