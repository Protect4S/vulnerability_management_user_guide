# Projects and scans

## What is the performance impact of running a scan on a satellite system?

A scan that is executed on the satellite system has a very low impact on performance. For ABAP system types, these are executed using a single dialogue process. Also, many checks are executed on the system context of the satellite system (a snapshot of parameters/variables etc). Based on experience, the execution of a scan is hardly noticed from a performance point of view.
