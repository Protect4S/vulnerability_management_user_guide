## What is Protect4S VM?

Protect4S Vulnerability Management (VM) is a solution to control and mitigate risks in SAP landscapes. See chapter [Introduction](../introduction/).&#x20;

## How does Protect4S VM work?

Protect4S VM is installed as an ABAP Add-On and operates as a central solution in an SAP landscape to run vulnerability scans on SAP systems. No agents are required on satellite systems, eliminating risk and maintenance effort. This makes Protect4S VM a solution that is easy to install, configure and maintain.

## What knowledge is required to operate Protect4S VM?

Basic SAP technical knowledge is required to install and setup the Protect4S VM solution to run scans. For mitigation of vulnerabilities, more advance technical or security knowledge may be required. To ease this process, the checks that are performed give detailed information about vulnerabilities found, possible solutions and references to background information.
