# Satellite system BusinessObjects user

Protect4S is able to scan SAP BusinessObjects BI based systems. For this purpose a user is needed on the SAP BusinessObjects BI system. The privileges required for this user are:

* The user must be part of the _**Everyone**_ group to check for missing SAP Security notes
* The user must be part of the _**Administrators**_ group for the authorization specific checks

Note: The above groups are BO application groups (not to be confused with Windows OS groups).

Note: The number of Administrator users you are allowed to create, depends on your individual BO license.&#x20;
