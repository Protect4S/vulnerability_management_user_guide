# Distribution of satellite role

The Protect4S RFC user in the satellite systems needs the role **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE** to work correctly. From time to time, this role needs to be updated.&#x20;

Should this happen, all Protect4S customers will be advised by mail to update the role in all satellite systems. This can be done using the CUA, manually or also via central update in Protect4S:

![Central update of satellite user role (Protect4S menu)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png>)

![Central update of satellite user role (Fiori menu)](<../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png>)

For this central update to work, an extra role must be added to the Protect4S ABAP RFC user : **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_PUSH.** The CUA must **not** be active.

### **Manual distribution of Protect4S satellite system user role**

It is also possible to download the required Protect4S satellite role from the Protect4S system.&#x20;

The 3 roles:

* **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE** for the ABAP RFC satellite system user
* **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_PUSH** the (optional) role for automatic role distribution
* **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_MITIGATE** the role required for the Mitigation of OSS Notes

are always shipped with every version of Protect4S.

### **Download the Protect4S role(s) you require**

Log in to the Protect4S system and execute transaction **PFCG**. Select the appropriate role **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE** and select from the menu "Role", "Download":

![Transaction PFCG, select Protect4S role](<../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png>)

From the PFCG menu, select "Role", "Download":

![Select Role, Download](<../.gitbook/assets/image (34).png>)

Confirm the popup:

Select a location for the role on your PC and save the file

![Save the role on your local PC](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

You may repeat this step for roles **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_PUSH** and **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_MITIGATE** when you use the automatic distribution of Protect4S satellite user roles or the Automatic Mitigation of OSS Notes functionality.

### **Upload the role to a satellite system**

Login to the satellite system, execute transaction PFCG and select Role, Upload from the PFCG menu:

![Select Role, Upload from the PFCG menu](<../.gitbook/assets/image (37).png>)

Confirm the popup:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

Select the role file you downloaded to your PC in the previous step:

![Select role file downloaded in the first step](<../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

Provide permission to upload the file:

![Provide permission for upload](<../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png>)

Overwrite the old version of the role that exists

![Ignore warning and overwrite old role version](<../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png>)

Make sure all lights are green in PFCG

![Make sure all 3 lights are green](<../.gitbook/assets/image (42).png>)

You may repeat this step for role **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_PUSH** if you want to use automatic distribution of Protect4S satellite user roles.

You may repeat this step for role **ESEC\_SA\_SATELLITE\_MITIGATE** if you want to use the Automatic application of OSS Notes functionality.

If one of the lights is not green, it could be that the authorization profile needs to be regenerated and/or redistributed to the Protect4S satellite system user. Ask an SAP user administrator to do this if you do not know how to do this.
