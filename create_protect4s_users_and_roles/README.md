Protect4S requires two different types of users:

* Application users with their applicable roles in the Protect4S system
* Different types of users in the satellite systems

## Protect4S system users <a href="#protect4s-application-users-in-the-sap-solution-manager" id="protect4s-application-users-in-the-sap-solution-manager"></a>

Protect4S is an application based on SAP WebDynpro and allows for multiple users accessing the functionality at the same time. In order to access the specific parts of the functionality, all Protect4S users need to be provided with a suitable user role.

* ✔ Due to the sensitive nature of the information that Protect4S generates, ERP-SEC recommends that due consideration is given to the role distribution.
* ✔ Please make sure to always use the latest version of these roles as provided in the Support Packages from ERP-SEC.
