# Feature request

Protect4S is very interested in finding out what our customers want and value, that is why we provided a Feature request menu item Information and support menu:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (172).png>)



This allows Protect4S users to ask for and specify any new features that they would like to see in Protect4S. If such a feature can be realized and if it adds value for all our customers, then Protect4S will seriously consider implementing it.

Alternatively, customers can contact us by e-mail to request new features.
