# Scan subscriptions

* A scan is a vulnerability assessment run by Protect4S VM.

Any contact person may subscribe him-/herself to the notification process for one or more Scan(s). This means that a mail will be send to the mail address supplied for the contact person and according to the notification period set for that user.

If such (a) subscription(s) exists, a periodic mail will inform the contact persons that some scans, which he/she has subscribed to, have finished during the last period. The mail contains links to each finished Scan. In order to see the Scan details, the contact person must first logon to the Protect4S system.

Scan subscriptions may be accessed via contact person menu using the button _"Scan subscriptions"._
