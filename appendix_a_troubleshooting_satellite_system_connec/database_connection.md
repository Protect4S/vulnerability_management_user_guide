# Database connection

For all database versions errors are written to the work process trace files (**dev\_w\***) in the SAP work directory. Consult these files for additional information and read the applicable SAP OSS Note for the relevant database type mentioned in [appendix B](../appendix\_b\_installation\_database\_libraries/) of this document. Also transaction SM21 might provide some further details.

In the case of SSL certificate errors for the Hana Database, specifically when you use self-signed certificates you might add the SSL option "_**sslvalidatecertificate=false"**_ in the Encryption parameters when creating the DB connection. This is not recommended but might apply for testing purposes.
