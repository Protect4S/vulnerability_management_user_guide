# JAVA connection

Errors occurring with the SAP Java satellite system connection are often caused by an initial or expired password of the JAVA user:

**Error shown in the system connection wizard**

Please logon to the satellite system with that user and update the password to the correct value. In addition also update the password in the SAP JAVA connection.



**WAF / Firewall / IDS / IPS**

In modern networks connections from the central Protect4S system to remote systems might be blocked by network devices like (Web Application) Firewalls or IDS/IPS devices. Make sure that these devices do not interfere with the connections and if needed add these connections or source- and target IP-addresses to the allow-list.
