# Heterogeneous database connections

If the database types of the Protect4S system and the satellite systems are different and you want to execute checks on the database application layer, you need to install additional database libraries on the server of the Protect4S system. For example:

* if your Protect4S system has a MaxDB database
* and your satellite systems have MSQL server databases

then you need to install the Microsoft MSSQL Server database drivers on your Protect4S system.

See [Appendix B](../appendix\_b\_installation\_database\_libraries/) for more information
