The results of a particular scan may be exported to a PDF file or to Excel. When the button "Scan export" is clicked the following screen is shown in the same tab:

By pressing the Export button, the scan information will be exported to a file in PDF or Excel format, depending on what is chosen. An advantage of exporting to Excel is that the Protect4S VM data can be enriched with own data.

* âœ” Instead of English, it is also possible to export the Scan in the Dutch language.
