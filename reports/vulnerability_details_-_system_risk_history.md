# Risk history

The risk history can be accessed via the "Risk history" button in the "Scan results" screen:

![Accessing Risk history for a satellite system from within a Scan](<../.gitbook/assets/image (193).png>)

but it can also be accessed via the Main menu option "Risk history":

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (199).png>)

it shows the main results of scans against the same system. The idea behind this graph is to show how the risk levels of a single satellite system change over time, for example due to a mitigation project (less Very High and High risks) or a system upgrade.

The risk history is very useful to provide as "evidence" of the effect of a mitigation project.

The table below the graph shows the different scans that took place on that satellite system. In this case these scans ran over a 2-year period on the same system. You can see the total number of checks increasing from 490 to 616.&#x20;

**Risk history**

In some places, you can see the Risks (orange to red) drop slightly. This is likely to be either the result of mitigation and remediation actions but it could also be the result of applying a support package stack.

To see the exact differences on check level, you have to use the [Scan Comparison report](https://userguide.protect4s.com/reports/vulnerability-overview).
