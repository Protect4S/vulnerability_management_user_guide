# Scan result

Scan results are generated as the result of a scan and consist of:

* scan information: aggregated results, 2 heat maps, the system context, company information and scan statistics
* check overview
* several reports: scan history, scan statistics, scan export and mitigation report

The "Scan results" report can be started from the launch pad or from Quick Setup using the following link:

![Accessing the Scan reports](<../.gitbook/assets/image (205).png>)

This will open a new tab containing a table with scans that have been executed:

![Vulnerability scan table](<../.gitbook/assets/image (243).png>)

After selecting a scan, by pressing on the appropriate display icon, a new tab will open containing the details of that particular scan.
