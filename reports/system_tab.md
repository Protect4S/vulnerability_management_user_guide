# System tab

When a scan is created with the "Save system context" property set, then a complete snapshot of the satellite system is taken during each execution of that scan. This way, the exact system context that existed at the time of the scan can still be inspected months later. See [Appendix F](../appendix\_f\_system\_context.md) for more details.

The system details information may be accessed by clicking on the "System context" button on the system tab:
